# Harry School CRM - Unified Ranking System (Students + Teachers) PRD

## Executive Summary

This PRD extends the existing Student Ranking System to include Teacher Performance Ranking within the same unified architecture. Teachers will be evaluated using similar points, efficiency, and quality metrics, with their performance directly impacting salary and bonus calculations. All functionality will be integrated into the existing "Rankings" section and current database architecture.

## üìä Database Schema Extensions (Existing Tables)

### Extend Existing student_rankings Table
```sql
-- Add user_type to differentiate students and teachers
ALTER TABLE student_rankings ADD COLUMN user_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'student' CHECK (user_type IN ('student', 'teacher'));
ALTER TABLE student_rankings ADD COLUMN efficiency_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0.00;
ALTER TABLE student_rankings ADD COLUMN quality_score DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0.00;
ALTER TABLE student_rankings ADD COLUMN performance_tier VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'standard';

-- Rename table to be more generic
ALTER TABLE student_rankings RENAME TO user_rankings;

-- Update indexes for both students and teachers
CREATE INDEX idx_user_rankings_type_org ON user_rankings(user_type, organization_id, total_points DESC);
```

### Extend Existing points_transactions Table
```sql
-- Extend existing table to support teacher transactions
ALTER TABLE points_transactions ADD COLUMN user_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'student' CHECK (user_type IN ('student', 'teacher'));
ALTER TABLE points_transactions ADD COLUMN efficiency_impact DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0.00;
ALTER TABLE points_transactions ADD COLUMN quality_impact DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0.00;
ALTER TABLE points_transactions ADD COLUMN affects_salary BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
ALTER TABLE points_transactions ADD COLUMN monetary_impact DECIMAL(10,2);

-- Rename student_id to user_id for generic usage
ALTER TABLE points_transactions RENAME COLUMN student_id TO user_id;
```

### Extend Existing achievements Table
```sql
-- Add teacher-specific achievement types
ALTER TABLE achievements ADD COLUMN target_user_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'both' CHECK (target_user_type IN ('student', 'teacher', 'both'));
ALTER TABLE achievements ADD COLUMN professional_development BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

### Extend Existing student_goals Table
```sql
-- Make goals table generic for both students and teachers
ALTER TABLE student_goals RENAME TO user_goals;
ALTER TABLE user_goals RENAME COLUMN student_id TO user_id;
ALTER TABLE user_goals ADD COLUMN user_type VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'student' CHECK (user_type IN ('student', 'teacher'));
ALTER TABLE user_goals ADD COLUMN affects_compensation BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;
```

### New Teacher-Specific Tables (Minimal)
```sql
-- Teacher evaluation criteria (reuses existing achievement structure)
CREATE TABLE evaluation_criteria (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    criteria_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    weight_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) DEFAULT 0.00,
    max_points INTEGER DEFAULT 100,
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    deleted_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id)
);

-- Teacher compensation tracking (extends existing structure)
CREATE TABLE compensation_adjustments (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    teacher_id UUID REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    adjustment_type VARCHAR(30),
    amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    performance_score DECIMAL(5,2),
    approved_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
    payment_status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    deleted_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    deleted_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id)
);
```
