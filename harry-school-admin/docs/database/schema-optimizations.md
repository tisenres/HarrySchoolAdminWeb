# Database Schema Optimizations for Harry School CRM

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive database schema optimizations and indexing strategies for production deployment of Harry School CRM with Supabase/PostgreSQL.

## Optimized Index Strategy

### 1. Core Entity Indexes

#### Students Table Optimizations
```sql
-- Primary performance indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_organization_active 
  ON students(organization_id, id) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND is_active = true;

-- Full-text search index (multi-language support)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_full_text_search 
  ON students USING gin(
    to_tsvector('english', 
      coalesce(full_name, '') || ' ' || 
      coalesce(primary_phone, '') || ' ' || 
      coalesce(student_id, '') || ' ' ||
      coalesce(parent_name, '')
    )
  ) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Composite filtering index
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_status_payment_level 
  ON students(organization_id, status, payment_status, current_level) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Phone number exact match (for quick lookup)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_phone_unique 
  ON students(organization_id, primary_phone) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND primary_phone IS NOT NULL;

-- Student ID unique lookup
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_student_id_unique 
  ON students(organization_id, student_id) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Date-based queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_enrollment_date 
  ON students(organization_id, enrollment_date DESC) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Age-based filtering (computed column)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_birth_date 
  ON students(organization_id, date_of_birth) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Balance and payment status
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_payment_balance 
  ON students(organization_id, payment_status, balance) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND balance > 0;

-- Partial index for overdue payments
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_overdue_payments 
  ON students(organization_id, enrollment_date, balance) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND payment_status = 'overdue';
```

#### Groups Table Optimizations
```sql
-- Core group filtering
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_organization_active 
  ON groups(organization_id, id) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND is_active = true;

-- Full-text search for groups
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_full_text_search 
  ON groups USING gin(
    to_tsvector('english', 
      coalesce(name, '') || ' ' || 
      coalesce(group_code, '') || ' ' || 
      coalesce(subject, '') || ' ' ||
      coalesce(description, '')
    )
  ) WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Subject and level filtering
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_subject_level_status 
  ON groups(organization_id, subject, level, status) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Group code unique lookup
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_code_unique 
  ON groups(organization_id, group_code) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Schedule-based queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_schedule 
  ON groups USING gin(schedule) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND is_active = true;

-- Enrollment capacity queries
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_enrollment_capacity 
  ON groups(organization_id, current_enrollment, max_students, status) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Date-based filtering
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_start_date 
  ON groups(organization_id, start_date DESC) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Classroom scheduling
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_classroom_schedule 
  ON groups(organization_id, classroom, start_date) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND classroom IS NOT NULL;
```

#### Teachers Table Optimizations (from existing schema)
```sql
-- Enhanced teacher indexes
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_teachers_specializations_gin 
  ON teachers USING gin(specializations) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Assignment availability
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_teachers_employment_status 
  ON teachers(organization_id, employment_status, is_active) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Performance tracking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_teachers_updated 
  ON teachers(organization_id, updated_at DESC) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### 2. Relationship Table Indexes

#### Student-Group Enrollments
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS student_group_enrollments (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES organizations(id),
  student_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES students(id),
  group_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES groups(id),
  enrollment_date date NOT NULL,
  start_date date NOT NULL,

  updated_at timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
  created_by uuid REFERENCES profiles(id),
  updated_by uuid REFERENCES profiles(id),
  deleted_at timestamptz,
  deleted_by uuid REFERENCES profiles(id)
);

-- Optimized indexes for enrollments

  ON student_group_enrollments(organization_id, student_id, group_id) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_enrollments_student_status 
  ON student_group_enrollments(student_id, status) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_enrollments_group_status 
  ON student_group_enrollments(group_id, status) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_enrollments_payment_status 
  ON student_group_enrollments(organization_id, payment_status, tuition_amount) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_enrollments_date_range 
  ON student_group_enrollments(organization_id, enrollment_date, end_date) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

#### Teacher-Group Assignments
```sql
-- Enhanced teacher assignments

  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_teacher_assignments_group_active 
  ON teacher_group_assignments(organization_id, group_id, status) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND status = 'active';

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_teacher_assignments_schedule 
  ON teacher_group_assignments(teacher_id, start_date, end_date) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

### 3. Performance-Optimized Materialized Views

#### Student Statistics View
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW student_statistics_mv AS
SELECT 
  organization_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_students,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active') as active_students,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'inactive') as inactive_students,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'graduated') as graduated_students,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'suspended') as suspended_students,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'dropped') as dropped_students,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'overdue') as overdue_payments,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'pending') as pending_payments,
  SUM(balance) as total_balance,
  AVG(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM age(CURRENT_DATE, date_of_birth::date))) as average_age,
  -- Status breakdown
  json_object_agg(status, status_count) as status_breakdown,
  -- Level breakdown  
  json_object_agg(current_level, level_count) as level_breakdown,
  -- Payment status breakdown
  json_object_agg(payment_status, payment_count) as payment_breakdown,
  updated_at
FROM students s
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT status, COUNT(*) as status_count 
  FROM students s2 
  WHERE s2.organization_id = s.organization_id 
    AND s2.deleted_at IS NULL 
  GROUP BY status
) status_stats
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT current_level, COUNT(*) as level_count 
  FROM students s3 
  WHERE s3.organization_id = s.organization_id 
    AND s3.deleted_at IS NULL 
  GROUP BY current_level
) level_stats
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT payment_status, COUNT(*) as payment_count 
  FROM students s4 
  WHERE s4.organization_id = s.organization_id 
    AND s4.deleted_at IS NULL 
  GROUP BY payment_status
) payment_stats
WHERE s.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY s.organization_id, updated_at;

-- Index on materialized view
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_student_stats_mv_org 
  ON student_statistics_mv(organization_id);
```

#### Group Statistics View
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW group_statistics_mv AS
SELECT 
  organization_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_groups,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active') as active_groups,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'upcoming') as upcoming_groups,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') as completed_groups,
  SUM(max_students) as total_capacity,
  SUM(current_enrollment) as total_enrollment,
  ROUND((SUM(current_enrollment)::numeric / NULLIF(SUM(max_students), 0) * 100), 2) as enrollment_rate,
  json_object_agg(subject, subject_count) as subject_breakdown,
  json_object_agg(level, level_count) as level_breakdown,
  json_object_agg(status, status_count) as status_breakdown,
  updated_at
FROM groups g
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT subject, COUNT(*) as subject_count 
  FROM groups g2 
  WHERE g2.organization_id = g.organization_id 
    AND g2.deleted_at IS NULL 
  GROUP BY subject
) subject_stats
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT level, COUNT(*) as level_count 
  FROM groups g3 
  WHERE g3.organization_id = g.organization_id 
    AND g3.deleted_at IS NULL 
  GROUP BY level
) level_stats
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT status, COUNT(*) as status_count 
  FROM groups g4 
  WHERE g4.organization_id = g.organization_id 
    AND g4.deleted_at IS NULL 
  GROUP BY status
) status_stats
WHERE g.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY g.organization_id, updated_at;

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_group_stats_mv_org 
  ON group_statistics_mv(organization_id);
```

#### Enrollment Trends View
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW enrollment_trends_mv AS
WITH monthly_enrollments AS (
  SELECT 
    organization_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', enrollment_date) as enrollment_month,
    COUNT(*) as enrollment_count,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active') as active_enrollments,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payment_status = 'paid') as paid_enrollments
  FROM students 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL 
    AND enrollment_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '24 months'
  GROUP BY organization_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', enrollment_date)
),
monthly_series AS (
  SELECT 
    organization_id,
    generate_series(
      DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '23 months'),
      DATE_TRUNC('month', CURRENT_DATE),
      INTERVAL '1 month'
    ) as month
  FROM organizations
)
SELECT 
  ms.organization_id,
  ms.month,
  COALESCE(me.enrollment_count, 0) as enrollment_count,
  COALESCE(me.active_enrollments, 0) as active_enrollments,
  COALESCE(me.paid_enrollments, 0) as paid_enrollments,
  -- Running totals
  SUM(COALESCE(me.enrollment_count, 0)) OVER (
    PARTITION BY ms.organization_id 
    ORDER BY ms.month 
    ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
  ) as cumulative_enrollments
FROM monthly_series ms
LEFT JOIN monthly_enrollments me ON ms.organization_id = me.organization_id 
  AND ms.month = me.enrollment_month
ORDER BY ms.organization_id, ms.month;

CREATE INDEX idx_enrollment_trends_mv_org_month 
  ON enrollment_trends_mv(organization_id, month DESC);
```

### 4. Advanced Query Optimization

#### Partial Indexes for Common Queries
```sql
-- Active students with overdue payments
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_active_overdue 
  ON students(organization_id, balance DESC, enrollment_date) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL 
    AND is_active = true 
    AND payment_status = 'overdue';

-- Available group capacity
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_available_capacity 
  ON groups(organization_id, (max_students - current_enrollment) DESC) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL 
    AND is_active = true 
    AND current_enrollment < max_students;

-- Recent enrollments for dashboard
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_recent_enrollments 
  ON students(organization_id, enrollment_date DESC) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL 
    AND enrollment_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

#### Composite Indexes for Complex Queries
```sql
-- Student search with filters
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_search_composite 
  ON students(organization_id, status, payment_status, current_level, full_name) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Group search with filters
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_search_composite 
  ON groups(organization_id, subject, level, status, name) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Schedule conflict detection
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_schedule_conflict 
  ON groups(organization_id, classroom, start_date, end_date) 
  WHERE deleted_at IS NULL 
    AND is_active = true 
    AND classroom IS NOT NULL;
```

### 5. Database Functions for Performance

#### Fast Student Search Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION search_students(
  org_id uuid,
  search_query text,
  status_filter text[] DEFAULT NULL,
  payment_filter text[] DEFAULT NULL,
  limit_count int DEFAULT 20,
  offset_count int DEFAULT 0
)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id uuid,
  student_id varchar,
  full_name varchar,
  phone varchar,
  status varchar,
  payment_status varchar,
  balance decimal,
  enrollment_date date
) 
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
  search_vector tsvector;
BEGIN
  -- Convert search query to tsquery
  search_vector := plainto_tsquery('english', search_query);
  
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT 
    s.id,
    s.student_id,
    s.full_name,
    s.primary_phone,
    s.status::varchar,
    s.payment_status::varchar,
    s.balance,
    s.enrollment_date
  FROM students s
  WHERE s.organization_id = org_id
    AND s.deleted_at IS NULL
    AND (
      search_query = '' OR
      to_tsvector('english', 
        coalesce(s.full_name, '') || ' ' || 
        coalesce(s.primary_phone, '') || ' ' || 
        coalesce(s.student_id, '')
      ) @@ search_vector OR
      s.primary_phone LIKE '%' || search_query || '%' OR
      s.student_id ILIKE '%' || search_query || '%'
    )
    AND (status_filter IS NULL OR s.status = ANY(status_filter))
    AND (payment_filter IS NULL OR s.payment_status = ANY(payment_filter))
  ORDER BY 
    CASE 
      WHEN s.student_id ILIKE search_query || '%' THEN 1
      WHEN s.primary_phone LIKE search_query || '%' THEN 2
      WHEN s.full_name ILIKE search_query || '%' THEN 3
      ELSE 4
    END,
    s.full_name
  LIMIT limit_count
  OFFSET offset_count;
END;
$$;
```

#### Group Statistics Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_group_statistics(org_id uuid)
RETURNS json
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
  result json;
BEGIN
  SELECT json_build_object(
    'total_groups', COUNT(*),
    'active_groups', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'active'),
    'upcoming_groups', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'upcoming'),
    'completed_groups', COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed'),
    'total_capacity', SUM(max_students),
    'total_enrollment', SUM(current_enrollment),
    'enrollment_rate', ROUND(
      (SUM(current_enrollment)::numeric / NULLIF(SUM(max_students), 0) * 100), 2
    ),
    'by_subject', json_object_agg(subject, subject_count),
    'by_level', json_object_agg(level, level_count),
    'by_status', json_object_agg(status, status_count)
  )
  INTO result
  FROM groups g
  CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT subject, COUNT(*) as subject_count
    FROM groups g2 
    WHERE g2.organization_id = g.organization_id 
      AND g2.deleted_at IS NULL 
    GROUP BY subject
  ) subj
  CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT level, COUNT(*) as level_count
    FROM groups g3 
    WHERE g3.organization_id = g.organization_id 
      AND g3.deleted_at IS NULL 
    GROUP BY level
  ) lvl
  CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT status, COUNT(*) as status_count
    FROM groups g4 
    WHERE g4.organization_id = g.organization_id 
      AND g4.deleted_at IS NULL 
    GROUP BY status
  ) stat
  WHERE g.organization_id = org_id 
    AND g.deleted_at IS NULL;
    
  RETURN COALESCE(result, '{}'::json);
END;
$$;
```

### 6. Maintenance and Monitoring

#### Automatic Statistics Refresh
```sql
-- Create extension for cron jobs
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_cron;

-- Schedule materialized view refreshes
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-student-stats',
  '*/15 * * * *',  -- Every 15 minutes
  'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY student_statistics_mv;'
);

SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-group-stats',
  '*/15 * * * *',  -- Every 15 minutes
  'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY group_statistics_mv;'
);

SELECT cron.schedule(
  'refresh-enrollment-trends',
  '0 * * * *',     -- Every hour
  'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY enrollment_trends_mv;'
);
```

#### Index Maintenance
```sql
-- Create function to rebuild indexes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION rebuild_performance_indexes()
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Reindex concurrently (PostgreSQL 12+)
  REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_full_text_search;
  REINDEX INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_full_text_search;
  
  -- Update table statistics
  ANALYZE students;
  ANALYZE groups;
  ANALYZE student_group_enrollments;
  ANALYZE teacher_group_assignments;
  
  RAISE NOTICE 'Performance indexes rebuilt successfully';
END;
$$;

-- Schedule weekly index maintenance
SELECT cron.schedule(
  'rebuild-indexes',
  '0 2 * * 0',     -- Every Sunday at 2 AM
  'SELECT rebuild_performance_indexes();'
);
```

#### Query Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- Enable query logging for slow queries
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_min_duration_statement = 1000; -- Log queries > 1 second
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_statement = 'all';
ALTER SYSTEM SET log_duration = on;

-- Create monitoring view
CREATE VIEW slow_queries AS
SELECT 
  query,
  calls,
  total_time,
  mean_time,
  rows,
  100.0 * shared_blks_hit / nullif(shared_blks_hit + shared_blks_read, 0) AS hit_percent
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE mean_time > 100  -- Queries averaging > 100ms
ORDER BY total_time DESC;
```
