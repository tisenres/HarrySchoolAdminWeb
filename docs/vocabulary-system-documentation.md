### Optimized Queries

```sql
-- Get vocabulary units with progress for a student
SELECT 
  vu.id as unit_id,
  vu.title_en,
  COUNT(vw.id)::INTEGER as total_words,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN svp.mastery_level = 'mastered' THEN 1 END)::INTEGER as mastered_words,
  (COUNT(CASE WHEN svp.mastery_level = 'mastered' THEN 1 END)::DECIMAL / COUNT(vw.id)::DECIMAL * 100) as progress_percentage
FROM vocabulary_units vu
LEFT JOIN vocabulary_words vw ON vw.unit_id = vu.id AND vw.deleted_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN student_vocabulary_progress svp ON svp.word_id = vw.id AND svp.student_id = $1
WHERE vu.deleted_at IS NULL AND vu.is_active = true
GROUP BY vu.id
ORDER BY vu.display_order, vu.difficulty_level;
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

### VocabularyCacheService (`/mobile/packages/api/supabase/services/vocabulary-cache.service.ts`)

**Multi-Level Caching Strategy**:

1. **Memory Cache**: In-memory Map for instant access
2. **AsyncStorage**: Persistent local storage for offline support
3. **Supabase Cache Table**: Shared cache with intelligent TTL management
4. **Database**: Primary source with optimized queries

**Cache Types**:
- **Frequent** (500 words, 24h TTL): Most accessed across all students
- **Recent** (200 words, 6h TTL): Student's recently studied words
- **Struggling** (100 words, 12h TTL): Difficult words needing attention
- **Mastered** (150 words, 7d TTL): Fully learned words for reinforcement

**Performance Features**:
```typescript
public async getWord(
  wordId: string, 
  studentId?: string,
  cacheType: CacheType = 'frequent'
): Promise<CachedVocabularyWord | null> {
  const cacheKey = this.generateCacheKey(wordId, studentId, cacheType);
  
  // Check memory cache first
  if (this.memoryCache.has(cacheKey)) {
    this.cacheStats.hits++;
    return this.memoryCache.get(cacheKey)!;
  }
  
  // Fallback to Supabase cache, then database
  // Implementation continues...
}
```

### Database Optimization

**Indexes for Performance**:
- Composite indexes on organization_id, is_active, display_order
- FSRS-specific indexes on due_date, state, mastery_level
- Full-text search indexes for vocabulary lookup
- Cache access pattern optimization

**Query Optimization**:
- Materialized views for complex aggregations
- Partial indexes for active records only
- Batch operations for progress updates
- Connection pooling and prepared statements

## 🧠 FSRS Algorithm Integration

### Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler

The system implements a sophisticated FSRS algorithm for optimal vocabulary retention:

**Core Algorithm**:
```typescript
const updateVocabularyProgressFSRS = (grade: number, currentProgress: VocabularyProgress) => {
  switch (grade) {
    case 1: // Again
      newStability = Math.max(currentProgress.stability * 0.5, 0.1);
      newDifficulty = Math.min(currentProgress.difficulty + 0.2, 10.0);
      scheduledDays = 1;
      break;
    case 3: // Good
      newStability = currentProgress.stability * 1.3;
      newDifficulty = Math.max(currentProgress.difficulty - 0.05, 0.1);
      scheduledDays = Math.max(Math.round(newStability), 1);
      break;
  }
  
  dueDate = new Date(Date.now() + scheduledDays * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
};
```

**Mastery Level Progression**:
- **Beginner**: New words, no reviews yet
- **Learning**: 1-3 reviews, building familiarity
- **Familiar**: 4+ reviews, good retention (>75% accuracy)
- **Mastered**: High stability (>30 days), excellent accuracy (>90%)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### React Native Components

**Gesture Handling**:
```typescript
import { PanGestureHandler, State } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import Animated, { 
  useAnimatedGestureHandler,
  useAnimatedStyle,
  useSharedValue,
  runOnJS,
  interpolate,
  withSpring 
} from 'react-native-reanimated';

const FlashcardGestures = () => {
  const translateX = useSharedValue(0);
  const rotation = useSharedValue(0);
  
  const gestureHandler = useAnimatedGestureHandler({
    onStart: () => {
      'worklet';
    },
    onActive: (event) => {
      'worklet';
      translateX.value = event.translationX;
      rotation.value = interpolate(translateX.value, [-300, 0, 300], [-15, 0, 15]);
    },
    onEnd: (event) => {
      'worklet';
      if (Math.abs(event.translationX) > SWIPE_THRESHOLD) {
        runOnJS(handleSwipe)(event.translationX > 0 ? 'known' : 'learning');
      } else {
        translateX.value = withSpring(0);
        rotation.value = withSpring(0);
      }
    },
  });
  
  const animatedStyle = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
    transform: [
      { translateX: translateX.value },
      { rotate: `${rotation.value}deg` },
    ],
  }));
  
  return (
    <PanGestureHandler onGestureEvent={gestureHandler}>
      <Animated.View style={[styles.flashcard, animatedStyle]}>
        {/* Flashcard content */}
      </Animated.View>
    </PanGestureHandler>
  );
};
```

**Audio Integration**:
```typescript
import { Audio } from 'expo-av';

const AudioManager = {
  async playPronunciation(audioUrl: string, language: 'en' | 'uz' | 'ru') {
    try {
      const { sound } = await Audio.Sound.createAsync(
        { uri: audioUrl },
        { shouldPlay: true, volume: 1.0 }
      );
      
      sound.setOnPlaybackStatusUpdate((status) => {
        if (status.didJustFinish) {
          sound.unloadAsync();
        }
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.warn('Audio playback failed:', error);
      // Fallback to text-to-speech
      this.speakText(word, language);
    }
  },
  
  async speakText(text: string, language: string) {
    // Text-to-speech implementation
  }
};
```

### Memory Management Integration

The system uses an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for intelligent memory management:

```typescript
// Memory entities created for vocabulary caching
const vocabularyMemoryEntities = [
  {
    name: "VocabularyMemoryCache",
    type: "system",
    observations: [
      "Memory caching system for frequently accessed vocabulary words",
      "Optimizes performance by storing commonly used words in memory",
      "Reduces database queries for popular vocabulary items"
    ]
  },
  {
    name: "FrequentWordsCache",
    type: "cache", 
    observations: [
      "Cache for most frequently accessed vocabulary words across all students",
      "Updates based on access patterns and usage statistics",
      "Stores word data with translations for quick retrieval"
    ]
  }
];
```
