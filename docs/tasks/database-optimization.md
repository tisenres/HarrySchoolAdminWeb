# Database Optimization Plan: Groups Management System
Agent: database-optimizer
Date: 2025-08-21

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive database optimization plan targets the Harry School Teacher App Groups management system, based on the comprehensive mobile architecture requirements identified in `/docs/tasks/groups-architecture.md`. The optimization strategy addresses performance bottlenecks for handling large datasets while supporting 500+ students, 25+ groups, 50+ teachers, and cultural requirements for the Uzbekistan educational context.

**Key Performance Targets:**
- Group switching: <500ms (current: potentially >1s with joins)
- Student list loading: <1 second (with pagination)
- Search queries: <300ms (with optimized indexes)
- Attendance operations: <60s for bulk marking
- Real-time subscriptions: <100ms latency

## Current Performance Analysis

### Database Statistics

Based on analysis of the existing Harry School Supabase schema:

```sql
-- Current table sizes and row counts
students: 21 rows, 344 kB total (with 22 dead rows - needs vacuum)
groups: 12 rows, 232 kB total (with 14 dead rows - needs vacuum) 
student_group_enrollments: 21 rows, 112 kB total
teacher_group_assignments: 6 rows
student_attendance: 0 rows, 80 kB allocated
notifications: 17 rows (with 15 dead rows - needs vacuum)
```

**Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **High Dead Row Ratio**: Multiple tables show ~50% dead rows, indicating poor vacuum scheduling
2. **Missing Attendance Data**: Zero attendance records despite allocated space suggests optimization opportunity
3. **Planning Time Bottleneck**: 50.230ms planning time for complex queries indicates need for better statistics

### Query Performance Analysis

Current query execution patterns show several optimization opportunities:

```sql
-- Example: Teacher's Groups with Student Counts
-- Current Performance: Sequential scans, multiple joins
-- Planning Time: 50.230ms (excessive)
-- Execution Time: 1.548ms (acceptable for current scale)

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT g.*, 
       COUNT(sge.student_id) as student_count,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN s.enrollment_status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_students
FROM groups g
LEFT JOIN student_group_enrollments sge ON g.id = sge.group_id AND sge.deleted_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN students s ON sge.student_id = s.id AND s.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE g.organization_id = ? AND g.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY g.id
ORDER BY g.created_at DESC;
```

**Performance Issues:**
- Sequential scans on all tables
- Lack of covering indexes for join operations
- No materialized views for frequently accessed aggregations
- Missing cultural data indexes for Unicode search

### Missing Indexes for Groups Management

Analysis of existing indexes shows good coverage for basic operations but gaps for mobile-specific patterns:

**Current Indexes (Groups Table):**
- `groups_pkey` (id)
- `idx_groups_org_active` (organization_id, is_active)
- `idx_groups_fts` (full-text search on name, description, subject)
- `idx_groups_org_subject_level` (organization_id, subject, level)

**Missing Critical Indexes:**
1. **Teacher Assignment Lookup**: No index for teacher-specific group queries
2. **Attendance Date Ranges**: Missing composite indexes for date-based filtering
3. **Cultural Search**: No trigram indexes for fuzzy name matching
4. **Bulk Operations**: No indexes optimized for batch updates

## Optimization Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Search and Navigation Indexes

#### 1.1 Teacher Groups Navigation Optimization

```sql
-- Index for teacher's groups lookup (primary mobile use case)
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_teacher_active_created
ON groups(organization_id, is_active, created_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Teacher assignment composite index
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_teacher_group_assignments_teacher_org
ON teacher_group_assignments(teacher_id, organization_id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Covering index for group list with student counts
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_list_covering
ON groups(organization_id, is_active, created_at DESC)
INCLUDE (id, name, subject, level, max_students, current_enrollment)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

#### 1.2 Student Search and Lookup Optimization

```sql
-- Trigram index for fuzzy name search (cultural names)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_name_trgm 
ON students USING gin (name gin_trgm_ops)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Phone number exact match index
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_phone_active 
ON students(primary_phone, organization_id) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND enrollment_status = 'active';

-- Parent name search for cultural context
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_parent_name_trgm
ON students USING gin (
  (COALESCE(jsonb_extract_path_text(cultural_info, 'parent_name'), '') || ' ' ||
   COALESCE(jsonb_extract_path_text(cultural_info, 'family_name'), '')) gin_trgm_ops
)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Multi-language search support
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_multi_lang_search
ON students USING gin (
  to_tsvector('english', COALESCE(full_name, '')) ||

  to_tsvector('simple', COALESCE(full_name, ''))
)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

#### 1.3 Group Enrollment and Capacity Optimization

```sql

ON student_group_enrollments(group_id, status, enrollment_date DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Student enrollment history
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_student_group_enrollments_student_active
ON student_group_enrollments(student_id, organization_id, status)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND status IN ('active', 'enrolled');

-- Group capacity monitoring
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_capacity_monitoring
ON groups(organization_id, (current_enrollment::float / max_students), is_active)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND is_active = true;
```

### Phase 2: Attendance and Performance Tracking

#### 2.1 Attendance Bulk Operations

```sql
-- High-performance attendance insertion and updates
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_student_attendance_bulk_ops
ON student_attendance(class_id, session_date, student_id)
INCLUDE (attendance_status, marked_at, marked_by);

-- Teacher attendance marking optimization
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_student_attendance_teacher_date_range
ON student_attendance(
  (SELECT teacher_id FROM teacher_group_assignments tga 
   JOIN groups g ON tga.group_id = g.id 
   WHERE g.id = student_attendance.class_id LIMIT 1),
  session_date DESC,
  attendance_status
)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Recent attendance for mobile sync
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_student_attendance_recent_sync
ON student_attendance(updated_at DESC, student_id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Date range queries for attendance reports
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_student_attendance_date_range_stats
ON student_attendance(session_date, attendance_status)
INCLUDE (student_id, class_id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

#### 2.2 Performance Analytics Indexes

```sql
-- Student performance tracking
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_performance_ranking
ON students(organization_id, total_points DESC, academic_score DESC, updated_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND enrollment_status = 'active';

-- Group performance comparison
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_performance_stats
ON groups(organization_id, subject, level)
INCLUDE (current_enrollment, start_date)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND is_active = true;

-- Teacher performance metrics
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_teachers_performance_composite
ON teachers(organization_id, total_points DESC, efficiency_percentage DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND status = 'active';
```

### Phase 3: Cultural and Communication Optimization

#### 3.1 Multi-language and Cultural Data

```sql
-- Cultural preferences and family structure
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_cultural_context
ON students USING gin (cultural_info)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Family communication preferences
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_communication_prefs
ON students(
  organization_id,
  jsonb_extract_path_text(cultural_info, 'family_language'),
  jsonb_extract_path_text(contact_info, 'preferred_communication_method')
)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Prayer time and Islamic calendar considerations
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_schedule_cultural
ON groups USING gin (schedule)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND jsonb_extract_path_text(schedule, 'islamic_calendar_aware') = 'true';
```

#### 3.2 Notification and Communication

-- Message queuing for offline sync
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_notifications_offline_queue
ON notifications(user_id, created_at DESC, is_read)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Phase 4: Specialized Mobile Optimizations

#### 4.1 Offline-First Architecture Support

```sql
-- Sync conflict resolution
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_all_tables_sync_metadata
ON students(updated_at DESC, id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Similar for other tables

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_attendance_sync_metadata
ON student_attendance(updated_at DESC, id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Incremental sync support
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_incremental_sync
ON students(organization_id, updated_at DESC)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

#### 4.2 Pagination and Virtual Scrolling

```sql
-- Cursor-based pagination for large lists
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_students_cursor_pagination
ON students(organization_id, created_at DESC, id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Group listing with efficient pagination
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_groups_cursor_pagination  
ON groups(organization_id, created_at DESC, id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Attendance history pagination
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_attendance_cursor_pagination
ON student_attendance(student_id, session_date DESC, id)
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;
```

## Query Optimization Patterns

### 1. Teacher Dashboard Queries

#### Optimized Groups List for Teacher
```sql
-- Before: Multiple joins and sequential scans
-- After: Single query with covering indexes
WITH teacher_groups AS (
  SELECT g.id, g.name, g.subject, g.level, g.max_students, g.current_enrollment,
         g.schedule, g.created_at, g.classroom
  FROM groups g
  JOIN teacher_group_assignments tga ON g.id = tga.group_id
  WHERE tga.teacher_id = $1 
    AND tga.organization_id = $2
    AND g.deleted_at IS NULL 
    AND tga.deleted_at IS NULL
    AND g.is_active = true
  ORDER BY g.created_at DESC
)
SELECT tg.*,
       COALESCE(enrollment_stats.active_count, 0) as active_students,
       COALESCE(attendance_stats.avg_attendance, 0) as avg_attendance_rate
FROM teacher_groups tg
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT COUNT(*) as active_count
  FROM student_group_enrollments sge
  JOIN students s ON sge.student_id = s.id
  WHERE sge.group_id = tg.id 
    AND sge.status = 'active'
    AND sge.deleted_at IS NULL 
    AND s.deleted_at IS NULL
) enrollment_stats ON true
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN sa.attendance_status = 'present' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as avg_attendance
  FROM student_attendance sa
  WHERE sa.class_id = tg.id
    AND sa.session_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
    AND sa.deleted_at IS NULL
) attendance_stats ON true;
```

#### Optimized Student Search with Cultural Context
```sql
-- Fuzzy search with cultural considerations
SELECT s.id, s.full_name, s.primary_phone, 
       s.cultural_info->>'parent_name' as parent_name,
       s.cultural_info->>'family_language' as family_language,
       s.enrollment_status,
       similarity(s.full_name, $2) as name_similarity
FROM students s
WHERE s.organization_id = $1
  AND s.deleted_at IS NULL
  AND (
    s.full_name % $2 OR  -- Trigram similarity
    s.primary_phone LIKE $2 || '%' OR
    s.cultural_info->>'parent_name' % $2
  )
ORDER BY 
  CASE WHEN s.enrollment_status = 'active' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END,
  similarity(s.full_name, $2) DESC,
  s.full_name
LIMIT 50;
```

### 2. Attendance Bulk Operations

#### Gesture-Based Bulk Attendance Marking
```sql
-- Optimized bulk attendance upsert
INSERT INTO student_attendance (
  student_id, class_id, session_date, attendance_status, 
  marked_by, marked_at, organization_id, cultural_context
)
SELECT 
  unnest($1::uuid[]) as student_id,
  $2::uuid as class_id,
  $3::date as session_date,
  unnest($4::text[]) as attendance_status,
  $5::uuid as marked_by,
  NOW() as marked_at,
  $6::uuid as organization_id,
  $7::jsonb as cultural_context
ON CONFLICT (student_id, class_id, session_date)
DO UPDATE SET
  attendance_status = EXCLUDED.attendance_status,
  marked_by = EXCLUDED.marked_by,
  marked_at = EXCLUDED.marked_at,
  updated_at = NOW();
```

### 3. Real-time Subscription Optimization

#### Efficient Change Detection for Mobile Sync
```sql
-- Optimized change detection for real-time subscriptions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_teacher_data_changes(
  teacher_id_param uuid,
  organization_id_param uuid,
  since_timestamp timestamptz DEFAULT NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
) RETURNS TABLE (
  table_name text,
  record_id uuid,
  operation text,
  data jsonb,
  timestamp timestamptz
) AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Groups changes
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT 'groups'::text, g.id, 'UPDATE'::text, to_jsonb(g), g.updated_at
  FROM groups g
  JOIN teacher_group_assignments tga ON g.id = tga.group_id
  WHERE tga.teacher_id = teacher_id_param
    AND g.organization_id = organization_id_param
    AND g.updated_at > since_timestamp
    AND g.deleted_at IS NULL;
    
  -- Students changes
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT 'students'::text, s.id, 'UPDATE'::text, to_jsonb(s), s.updated_at
  FROM students s
  JOIN student_group_enrollments sge ON s.id = sge.student_id
  JOIN teacher_group_assignments tga ON sge.group_id = tga.group_id
  WHERE tga.teacher_id = teacher_id_param
    AND s.organization_id = organization_id_param
    AND s.updated_at > since_timestamp
    AND s.deleted_at IS NULL;
    
  -- Attendance changes
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT 'student_attendance'::text, sa.id, 'UPDATE'::text, to_jsonb(sa), sa.updated_at
  FROM student_attendance sa
  JOIN groups g ON sa.class_id = g.id
  JOIN teacher_group_assignments tga ON g.id = tga.group_id
  WHERE tga.teacher_id = teacher_id_param
    AND sa.updated_at > since_timestamp
    AND sa.deleted_at IS NULL;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql STABLE;
```

## Caching and Materialized Views Strategy

### 1. Teacher Dashboard Materialized Views

```sql
-- Materialized view for teacher group summaries
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_teacher_group_summary AS
SELECT 
  tga.teacher_id,
  tga.organization_id,
  g.id as group_id,

  COUNT(sge.student_id) as enrolled_students,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN s.enrollment_status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active_students,
  AVG(CASE WHEN sa.attendance_status = 'present' THEN 1.0 ELSE 0.0 END) as avg_attendance_30d,
  MAX(sa.session_date) as last_attendance_date,
  g.created_at,
  g.updated_at
FROM teacher_group_assignments tga
JOIN groups g ON tga.group_id = g.id
LEFT JOIN student_group_enrollments sge ON g.id = sge.group_id AND sge.deleted_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN students s ON sge.student_id = s.id AND s.deleted_at IS NULL
LEFT JOIN student_attendance sa ON g.id = sa.class_id 
  AND sa.session_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
  AND sa.deleted_at IS NULL
WHERE tga.deleted_at IS NULL AND g.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY tga.teacher_id, tga.organization_id, g.id, g.name, g.subject, g.level, 
         g.max_students, g.current_enrollment, g.schedule, g.classroom, g.created_at, g.updated_at;

-- Indexes on materialized view
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_mv_teacher_group_summary_pkey 
ON mv_teacher_group_summary(teacher_id, group_id);

CREATE INDEX idx_mv_teacher_group_summary_teacher_org
ON mv_teacher_group_summary(teacher_id, organization_id, created_at DESC);

-- Refresh schedule (every 5 minutes during school hours)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION refresh_teacher_group_summary()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_teacher_group_summary;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 2. Student Performance Cache

```sql
-- Materialized view for student performance rankings
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_student_performance_ranking AS
WITH student_stats AS (
  SELECT 
    s.id,
    s.organization_id,
    s.full_name,
    s.total_points,
    s.academic_score,
    s.current_level,
    s.enrollment_status,
    s.cultural_info->>'family_language' as family_language,
    COUNT(sa.id) as total_attendance_records,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN sa.attendance_status = 'present' THEN 1 END) as present_count,
    ROUND(
      COUNT(CASE WHEN sa.attendance_status = 'present' THEN 1 END)::numeric / 
      NULLIF(COUNT(sa.id), 0) * 100, 2
    ) as attendance_percentage,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY s.organization_id 
      ORDER BY s.total_points DESC, s.academic_score DESC
    ) as points_rank,
    RANK() OVER (
      PARTITION BY s.organization_id, s.current_level 
      ORDER BY s.total_points DESC, s.academic_score DESC
    ) as level_rank
  FROM students s
  LEFT JOIN student_attendance sa ON s.id = sa.student_id 
    AND sa.session_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
    AND sa.deleted_at IS NULL
  WHERE s.deleted_at IS NULL
  GROUP BY s.id, s.organization_id, s.full_name, s.total_points, s.academic_score, 
           s.current_level, s.enrollment_status, s.cultural_info
)
SELECT *,
       CASE 
         WHEN points_rank <= 10 THEN 'top'
         WHEN points_rank <= 50 THEN 'high'
         WHEN points_rank <= 100 THEN 'medium'
         ELSE 'developing'
       END as performance_tier
FROM student_stats;

-- Indexes for performance queries
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_mv_student_performance_ranking_pkey
ON mv_student_performance_ranking(id);

CREATE INDEX idx_mv_student_performance_ranking_org_points
ON mv_student_performance_ranking(organization_id, points_rank);

CREATE INDEX idx_mv_student_performance_ranking_level
ON mv_student_performance_ranking(organization_id, current_level, level_rank);
```

## Mobile-Specific Optimizations

### 1. Pagination Strategies

#### Cursor-Based Pagination Implementation
```sql
-- Efficient cursor-based pagination for student lists
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_students_page(

### 2. Offline-First Sync Optimization

#### Incremental Sync Support
```sql
-- Function for efficient incremental sync

## Cultural Data Optimizations

### 1. Unicode and Multi-language Support

#### Enhanced Text Search Configuration
```sql
-- Create custom text search configuration for multi-language support
CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION uzbek_multilang (COPY = simple);
CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION russian_extended (COPY = russian);

    'low_efficiency_indexes', (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM index_usage WHERE index_hit_percent < 95)
  ) as metrics;
```

### 2. Alert Thresholds and Monitoring

#### Performance Alert System
```sql
-- Function to check performance thresholds and generate alerts
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_performance_alerts()
RETURNS TABLE (
  alert_type text,
  severity text,
  message text,
  metric_value numeric,

END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 3. Mobile-Specific Performance Monitoring

#### Mobile App Performance Metrics
```sql
-- Track mobile-specific query patterns
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mobile_performance_log (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  teacher_id uuid NOT NULL,
  organization_id uuid NOT NULL,
  operation_type text NOT NULL, -- 'group_list', 'student_search', 'attendance_bulk', etc.

```

## Scalability Strategy

### 1. Capacity Planning for Growth

#### Current vs Target Scale Analysis
```sql
-- Capacity analysis for scaling from current to target size
WITH capacity_analysis AS (
  SELECT 
    'students' as entity_type,
    21 as current_count,
    500 as target_count,

  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'groups' as entity_type,
    12 as current_count,
    25 as target_count,
    ROUND((25.0 / 12.0), 1) as scale_factor
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'teachers' as entity_type,
    7 as current_count,
    50 as target_count,
    ROUND((50.0 / 7.0), 1) as scale_factor
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 
    'attendance_records' as entity_type,
    0 as current_count,
    125000 as target_count, -- 500 students * 250 school days
    999.9 as scale_factor

    WHEN scale_factor > 5 THEN 'Medium Impact'
    ELSE 'Low Impact'
  END as scaling_impact
FROM capacity_analysis
ORDER BY scale_factor DESC;
```

### 2. Partitioning Strategy for Large Tables

CREATE TABLE student_attendance_2024_2025 
PARTITION OF student_attendance_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-09-01') TO ('2025-07-01');

CREATE TABLE student_attendance_2025_2026 
PARTITION OF student_attendance_partitioned
FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-09-01') TO ('2026-07-01');

-- Create default partition for future data
CREATE TABLE student_attendance_default 
PARTITION OF student_attendance_partitioned
DEFAULT;

-- Indexes on partitioned tables
CREATE INDEX idx_student_attendance_2024_2025_student_date
ON student_attendance_2024_2025(student_id, session_date DESC);

CREATE INDEX idx_student_attendance_2024_2025_class_date
ON student_attendance_2024_2025(class_id, session_date DESC);

-- Function to create new partitions automatically
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_attendance_partition_for_year(year_start date)
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  partition_name text;
  year_end date;
BEGIN
  partition_name := 'student_attendance_' || EXTRACT(YEAR FROM year_start)::text || '_' || 
                   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM year_start + INTERVAL '1 year')::text;
  year_end := year_start + INTERVAL '1 year';
  
  EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE %I PARTITION OF student_attendance_partitioned
                  FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
                 partition_name, year_start, year_end);
  
  EXECUTE format('CREATE INDEX idx_%s_student_date ON %I(student_id, session_date DESC)',
                 partition_name, partition_name);
  
  EXECUTE format('CREATE INDEX idx_%s_class_date ON %I(class_id, session_date DESC)',
                 partition_name, partition_name);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

-- WAL and checkpointing
-- wal_buffers = 16MB
-- checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
-- max_wal_size = 2GB

-- Query planner
-- default_statistics_target = 1000 (for better estimates on large tables)
-- constraint_exclusion = partition (for partitioned tables)

-- Create function to apply recommended settings
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_recommended_pg_settings()
RETURNS TABLE (setting_name text, current_value text, recommended_value text, impact text) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT 
    'shared_buffers'::text,
