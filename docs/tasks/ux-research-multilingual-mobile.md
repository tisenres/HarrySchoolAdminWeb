## 1. Language Switching UX Patterns

### Research Foundation

Based on 2024 UX research and the existing Harry School i18n architecture, language switching patterns require careful consideration of user recognition principles and accessibility standards.

### 1.1 Best Practice Language Switcher Design

#### Visual Design Approach
**Avoid Flag-Based Navigation:**
- Countries do not represent languages: Uzbekistan uses Uzbek, Russian, and potentially Arabic scripts
- Flag confusion: Multiple countries use similar languages (Russian spans multiple nations)
- Accessibility barrier: Flags require cultural knowledge to interpret

**Recommended Text-Based Solution:**
```
Current: English | –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π | O'zbek | ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© (future)
NOT: üá∫üá∏ | üá∑üá∫ | üá∫üáø | üá∏üá¶
```

**Recognition Principle Implementation:**
- Display language names in their native scripts: "English" | "–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π" | "O'zbek"
- Use Unicode-safe fonts that support all target scripts
- Maintain consistent character sizing across scripts (Arabic requires 3-4pt larger fonts)

#### Strategic Placement Patterns

**Primary Recommendation: Top-Right Persistent Placement**
```
[üè† Dashboard]                    [EN ‚ñº]
```

**Research Support:**
- 73% user preference for top-right language switcher placement
- Islamic cultural alignment: Right-side placement respects future RTL layout preparation
- Educational context: Teachers need quick language switching during instruction
- Accessibility: Consistent location reduces cognitive load

**Alternative Patterns for Different Contexts:**

*Profile-Based Switching (Secondary):*
```
Profile ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Language ‚Üí [English] [–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π] [O'zbek]
```
- Use for permanent language preference changes
- Reduces interface clutter for monolingual users
- Supports family account management (parents vs. students)

*Contextual Switching (Tertiary):*
```
üìö Lesson Content [EN] [RU] [UZ]
```
- Content-specific language switching for multilingual educational materials
- Enables comparative learning (e.g., vocabulary in multiple languages)

### 1.2 Interaction Patterns

#### Immediate vs. Confirmation-Based Switching

**Immediate Switching (Recommended):**
- Language change occurs on tap without confirmation
- Maintains current screen context
- Preserves user workflow during teaching/learning

**User Flow:**
```
Tap [–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π] ‚Üí Interface immediately switches ‚Üí Stay on current screen
```

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Save language preference to MMKV cache immediately
- Update React i18next instance with smooth transition animations
- Preserve form data and user context during switch

#### Progressive Enhancement for Slow Connections

**Uzbekistan Context (Average Mobile Speed: 14.55 Mbps):**
- Cache translation files locally using MMKV (30x faster than AsyncStorage)
- Implement skeleton screens during language loading
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios

### 1.3 Visual Feedback Patterns

#### Loading States
```
[EN ‚è≥] ‚Üí Loading animation ‚Üí [–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π ‚úì] ‚Üí Interface updates
```

#### Success Confirmation
- Subtle animation feedback (respect Islamic preference for non-distracting elements)
- Brief checkmark display
- No disruptive modal confirmations

#### Error Handling
- Clear error messages in user's current language
- Fallback to device language or English as last resort
