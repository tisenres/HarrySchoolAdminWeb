### Information Hierarchy Principles

#### Visual Hierarchy Rules
1. **Scannable Structure**: F-pattern layout for quick information scanning
2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Summary → Details → Actions workflow
3. **Priority-Based Layout**: Most important information in top-left quadrant
4. **Cultural Reading Patterns**: Left-to-right, top-to-bottom for Latin script
5. **Professional Aesthetics**: Clean, authoritative design reinforcing teacher status

#### Content Density Management
```
Information Density Guidelines:
├── Critical Information (Always Visible)
│   ├── Current period/time
│   ├── Student names/photos
│   ├── Urgent notifications
│   └── Primary actions
├── Important Information (Summary View)
│   ├── Daily schedule
│   ├── Attendance status
│   ├── Pending grades
│   └── Recent messages
├── Detailed Information (On-Demand)
│   ├── Student history
│   ├── Grade calculations
│   ├── Full communications
│   └── Analytics data
└── Background Information (Settings/Profile)
    ├── App preferences
    ├── Professional data
    ├── System information
    └── Legal notices
```

#### Context-Aware Navigation

**Adaptive Interface Based on:**
- **Time of Day**: Different priorities for morning vs. afternoon
- **Day of Week**: Weekend vs. weekday interface variations
- **Academic Calendar**: Exam periods, holidays, special events
- **User Behavior**: Frequently used functions promoted to quick access
- **Cultural Context**: Prayer times, religious observances, national holidays

**Example Context Adaptations:**
```
Morning Context (7:00-9:00 AM):
├── Emphasize today's schedule
├── Highlight attendance tools
├── Show preparation reminders
└── Weather information for outdoor classes

Teaching Context (9:00 AM-2:00 PM):
├── Quick access to current class
├── Behavior logging tools
├── Emergency communication
└── Minimal interface distractions

Administrative Context (2:00-5:00 PM):
├── Grading and assessment tools
├── Parent communication center
├── Report generation
└── Planning for tomorrow

Evening Context (5:00 PM+):
├── Communication with parents
├── Lesson planning
├── Professional development
└── Personal preferences
```

## Accessibility & Usability Analysis

### Teacher-Specific Accessibility Needs

#### One-Handed Operation During Instruction

**Primary Use Case**: Teacher holding lesson materials, pointing at board, or managing classroom while using mobile device.

**Design Requirements:**
```
One-Handed Usability Standards:
├── Touch Target Size
│   ├── Minimum: 52pt (elementary education standard)
│   ├── Recommended: 56pt for professional use
│   ├── Spacing: 8pt minimum between targets
│   └── Edge consideration: Avoid far corners and top edge
├── Thumb-Friendly Zones
│   ├── Primary actions: Bottom third of screen
│   ├── Secondary actions: Middle third
│   ├── Tertiary actions: Top third (avoid)
│   └── Critical actions: Within easy thumb reach
├── Gesture Optimization
│   ├── Swipe patterns: Natural thumb movement
│   ├── Tap patterns: Single tap preferred
│   ├── Long press: 500ms delay for classroom noise
│   └── Double tap: Avoid accidental activation
└── Interface Adaptations
    ├── Floating action buttons: Bottom right
    ├── Navigation: Bottom of screen
    ├── Modal positioning: Lower half
    └── Keyboard avoidance: Smart repositioning
```

**Practical Implementation:**
- **Quick Attendance**: Swipe right (present) / left (absent) with student photos
- **Behavior Notes**: Voice-to-text with noise cancellation for classroom environment
- **Emergency Actions**: Large, red emergency button accessible with thumb
- **Navigation**: Bottom tabs optimized for portrait orientation

#### Vision Accessibility for Aging Teachers

**Challenges Addressed:**
- **Presbyopia**: Difficulty focusing on close objects (common 40+)
- **Reduced Contrast Sensitivity**: Need for higher contrast ratios
- **Light Sensitivity**: Classroom lighting variations
- **Color Vision**: Reduced ability to distinguish similar colors

**Solutions:**
```
Vision Accessibility Features:
├── Typography

│   ├── Adjustable: 16pt - 24pt range
│   ├── Font family: System fonts (SF Pro, Roboto)
│   └── Weight: Medium/Semibold for important text
├── Color & Contrast
│   ├── WCAG AAA compliance: 7:1 contrast ratio
│   ├── High contrast mode: Optional system-wide
│   ├── Color-blind friendly: No color-only information
│   └── Dark mode: OLED-optimized for battery life
├── Spacing & Layout
│   ├── Line height: 1.4x minimum
│   ├── Paragraph spacing: 24pt minimum
│   ├── White space: Generous around interactive elements
│   └── Visual hierarchy: Clear size and weight differences
└── Dynamic Adjustments
    ├── Respect system text size settings
    ├── Auto-brightness adaptation
    ├── Classroom lighting mode
    └── Reading mode for long content
```

└── Error Prevention
    ├── Clear labels and instructions
    ├── Confirmation for destructive actions
    ├── Input validation and feedback
    └── Smart defaults and suggestions
```

#### Interruption Management

**Context**: Teachers are frequently interrupted during app use by student questions, behavioral issues, or administrative requests.

**Interruption-Resilient Design:**
```
Interruption Management:
├── State Preservation
