│   └── Islamic values focus areas
├── Assessment Method Choice:
│   ├── Voice recording (most common - 45%)
│   ├── Photo + voice annotation (35%)
│   ├── Template + customization (15%)
│   └── Video demonstration (5%)
├── Cultural Review:
│   ├── Islamic values alignment check
│   ├── Respectful language verification
│   ├── Family appropriateness assessment
│   └── Educational value confirmation
├── Distribution Options:
│   ├── Immediate family notification
