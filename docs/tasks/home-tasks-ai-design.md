### 3. Cultural Content Adaptation

#### Uzbekistan Context Integration
```typescript
interface CulturalContentFramework {
  localContextIntegration: {
    geography: [
      "Tashkent landmarks and neighborhoods",
      "Uzbekistan regions and cities",
      "Central Asian geography and climate",
      "Silk Road historical connections",
      "Natural features (mountains, rivers, deserts)"
    ],
    culture: [
      "Traditional celebrations (Navruz, Independence Day)",
      "Family structures and relationships",
      "Food traditions and hospitality",
      "Music, dance, and artistic expressions",
      "Crafts and traditional skills"
    ],
    language: [
      "Uzbek language strengths as learning foundation",
      "Russian language skills as additional resource", 
      "Multilingual advantages in global communication",
      "Script diversity (Latin, Cyrillic) as cognitive flexibility",
      "Translation skills development"
    ],
    values: [
      "Respect for elders and teachers",
      "Family honor and community responsibility", 
      "Hospitality and friendship",
      "Education as family investment",
      "Cultural pride with global openness"
    ]
  };
  
  globalConnectionFramework: `
  When creating content that connects local and global perspectives:
  
  1. Start with Familiar (Uzbekistan context)
  2. Build Bridge (similarities/differences) 
  3. Explore Global (other cultures respectfully)
  4. Return Home (how this enriches Uzbek perspective)
  
  Example for Elementary:
  "Just like how families in Tashkent gather for plov on special occasions, families around the world have special foods they share together. In Italy, families might gather for pasta, and in Mexico, for tamales. What makes these meals special isn't just the food, but the love and togetherness - just like in Uzbek families. How does your family make meals special?"
  
  Example for Middle School:
  "The tradition of hospitality in Uzbekistan - welcoming guests with tea and treats - connects to similar traditions worldwide. This shows how human values transcend borders while each culture expresses them uniquely. How might understanding this help you connect with people from other countries?"
  
  Example for High School:
  "The Silk Road historically connected Uzbekistan to global trade and cultural exchange. Today, English language skills serve a similar connecting function - allowing you to share Uzbek perspectives globally while learning from others. How can you use English to share something valuable about Uzbek culture with the world?"
