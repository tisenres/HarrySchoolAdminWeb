  student_id: 'student-uuid',
  invoice_id: 'invoice-uuid',
  amount: 500.00,
  payment_method_type: 'card',
  payment_date: new Date().toISOString(),
  notes: 'Monthly tuition payment'
})

// Process and apply to invoice
await PaymentService.processPayment(payment.id)
```

### Generating an Invoice
```typescript
const invoice = await InvoiceService.create(
  {
    student_id: 'student-uuid',
    due_date: addDays(new Date(), 30).toISOString(),
    currency: 'USD',
    organization_id: 'org-uuid'
  },
  [
    {
      description: 'Monthly Tuition - Math Group',
      item_type: 'tuition',
      quantity: 1,

    }
  ]
)
```

const revenueReport = await ReportGeneratorService.generateRevenueReport({
  startDate: '2024-01-01',
  endDate: '2024-12-31',
  organizationId: 'org-uuid',
  reportType: 'revenue'
})

// Export to Excel
ReportGeneratorService.exportToExcel(revenueReport, 'revenue_report_2024')
```

## Migration Guide

### From Phase 3 to Phase 4
1. Run database migrations to create finance tables
2. Update TypeScript types from generated schema
3. Configure payment methods for organization
4. Set up default payment schedules
5. Import existing financial data if applicable
6. Test RLS policies with different user roles
7. Configure report templates and schedules

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 5 Considerations
- Payment gateway integrations (Stripe, PayPal)
- Automated payment reminders via email/SMS
- Financial forecasting and budgeting
- Parent portal for payment management
- Mobile app payment capabilities
- Advanced analytics with ML predictions
- Blockchain payment support
- Multi-currency support with exchange rates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Payment not applying to invoice
- Check invoice status (not cancelled)
- Verify payment amount matches remaining balance
- Ensure student_id matches on both records

**Issue**: Report generation timeout
- Reduce date range for large datasets
- Check database indexes are created
- Verify materialized views are refreshed

**Issue**: Export failing
- Check browser permissions for downloads
- Verify data format compatibility
- Ensure sufficient memory for large exports

## Conclusion

Phase 4 successfully implements a comprehensive financial management system with advanced reporting capabilities. The module provides secure, scalable, and user-friendly tools for managing educational institution finances, with extensive customization options and export capabilities for various stakeholder needs.
