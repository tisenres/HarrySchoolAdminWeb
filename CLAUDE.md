# Harry School CRM Development Guide

## üéØ Project Overview

**Harry School CRM** is a comprehensive educational management system for a private education center in Tashkent, focusing on:
- **Admin Panel**: Web-based management system (Next.js + Vercel)

## üõ† Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| **Web Frontend** | Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS, Storage) |
| **State Management** | Zustand (client), React Query (server) |
| **AI Services** | OpenAI GPT-4, Whisper API |
| **Deployment** | Vercel (web) |
| **Development** | Claude Code with MCP servers + Subagents |

## üìÅ Context Management Strategy

### Shared Context File
All agents use `/docs/tasks/context.md` for maintaining project continuity.

```markdown
# Project Context: [Feature Name]
Last Updated: [timestamp]

## Current Status
- Phase: [planning/development/testing/complete]
- Active Agent: [agent-name]

## Completed Work
- [timestamp] [agent-name]: [summary]

## Research Reports
- backend-architecture.md
- frontend-design.md
- ai-integration.md

## Next Steps
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
```

### Agent Workflow

1. **Before Work**: Read `/docs/tasks/context.md`
2. **During Work**: Research and plan (never implement)
3. **After Work**: Update context file and save research

```

## üìã Development Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Planning Phase
```bash
# Create context and plan sprint
"Create context file at /docs/tasks/context.md for [feature]"
"Use sprint-prioritizer to plan research tasks"
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Research Phase
```bash
# Architecture research
"Use backend-architect to design database schema"
"Use frontend-developer to plan component architecture"
"Focus on admin panel component architecture"

# UX and design research
"Use ux-researcher to analyze user workflows"
"Use ui-designer to create design specifications"
"Use whimsy-injector to plan micro-interactions"

# Quality research
"Use security-auditor to assess security requirements"
"Use test-automator to plan testing strategy"
"Use performance-analyzer to identify optimizations"
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Implementation Phase
```bash
# Main agent implements based on research
"Implement [feature] using research from /docs/tasks/"
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment Phase
```bash
# Deployment preparation
"Use deployment-strategist to plan release strategy"
"Use test-runner to configure CI/CD pipeline"
```

## üöÄ Quick Commands

### Feature Development
```bash
# Complete feature with all agents
"Plan and research the student enrollment feature using relevant subagents, then implement based on their research"
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Optimize existing feature
"Use performance-analyzer to analyze the student list performance, then implement optimizations"
```

### Security Audit
```bash
# Security review
"Use security-auditor to review the authentication system, then implement necessary security improvements"
```


## üìä Development Phases

| Phase | Duration | Focus | Key Agents |
|-------|----------|-------|------------|
| **Foundation** | Weeks 1-2 | Database, Auth, UI Framework | backend-architect, security-auditor, ui-designer |
| **Core Modules** | Weeks 3-6 | Teachers, Students, Groups | frontend-developer, backend-architect |
| **Advanced** | Weeks 7-8 | Notifications, Search, Performance | performance-analyzer, database-optimizer |
| **Polish** | Weeks 9-10 | Testing, Deployment | test-automator, deployment-strategist |

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### DO
- ‚úÖ Always use context file (`/docs/tasks/context.md`)
- ‚úÖ Let subagents research, main agent implements
- ‚úÖ Document all research in `/docs/tasks/`
- ‚úÖ Use appropriate MCP servers for each task
- ‚úÖ Update context after each work session

### DON'T
- ‚ùå Let subagents implement code
- ‚ùå Skip reading context file
- ‚ùå Lose research between sessions
- ‚ùå Ignore previous decisions
- ‚ùå Forget to update context

## üéØ Success Metrics

- **Code Coverage**: ‚â•90%
- **Performance**: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB initial
- **API Response**: <200ms
- **Security**: OWASP compliant

## üìö Core Features

### Admin Panel
- Teachers Management (CRUD + specializations)
- Students Management (enrollment, ranking)
- Groups Management (scheduling, capacity)
- Settings (users, configuration, archives)


## üîê Key Configurations

### Database
- Multi-tenant with organization isolation
- Soft delete pattern (deleted_at, deleted_by)
- Comprehensive audit trails
- RLS policies on all tables

### Authentication
- Admin-only access (no self-registration)
- Role hierarchy (superadmin, admin)
- Supabase Auth with JWT
- Session management

### Internationalization
- English (default)
- Russian
- Uzbek (Latin)

## üö® CRITICAL: Honesty and Status Reporting

### NEVER claim something is "ready" or "production-ready" unless:
- ‚úÖ ALL functionality has been implemented AND tested
- ‚úÖ Backend integration is complete and working
- ‚úÖ All buttons and UI elements are functional
- ‚úÖ Error handling is implemented
- ‚úÖ Data validation is working
- ‚úÖ Authentication/authorization is properly implemented

### ALWAYS be explicit about what IS and ISN'T working:
- ‚ùå "The feature is ready" (when only UI exists)
- ‚úÖ "The UI components are implemented, but backend integration is needed"
- ‚ùå "Everything is working"
- ‚úÖ "The form renders correctly, but submission isn't connected to the database yet"

### Status Classification:
- üî¥ **Concept/Design Only**: No working code
- üü° **UI Shell**: Components exist but no functionality
- üü† **Partial Implementation**: Some features work, others don't
- üü¢ **Feature Complete**: All functionality implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Fully tested, integrated, and deployed

### Always specify current status when reporting progress
